Xite for your software projects
===============================

Xite is a good tool to document your software projects.


Code plugin
-----------

Code plugin generates html page for every source file.


Code reports
------------

If your project uses some report tool you can add the reports destination directories to the resources and they will be imported in the Xite site.

Xite uses Gradle as build system, TestNG for tests and ReportNG for test reports.

You can look at our build.gradle and src/xite/xite/site.groovy for a hint. 


Syntax highlighting
-------------------

Follow <a href="/xite/code-highlighting.html">instructions</a> or view the Xite sources.

Xite site uses <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a>, keeped out of the distributed sources.
