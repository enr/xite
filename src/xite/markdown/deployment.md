Deployment
==========

Set credentials in home/.xite/settings.groovy


    deploy {
        ftp {
            enabled = false
            username = ''
            password = ''
            host = ''
            baseDirectory = ''
        }
    }

The base directory should exists.
(Caught: : could not change remote directory: 550 /www/atoito.com/projects/xite: No such file or directory)
that's all
