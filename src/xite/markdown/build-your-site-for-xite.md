Build your site for Xite
========================

You can use Xite for the creation of the site, if you like write in Markdown,
or you can use Xite to deploy it from the command line.

Using Xite conventions:

- the main directory for Xite sources is src/xite
- every file ending with ".md" in the markdown directory is transformed in html, maintaining the relative path (ie markdown/my/page.md will be /my/page.html)
- every file in resources directory will be copied in the destination dir, maintaining the relative path (ie resources/my/special/layout.css will be /my/special/layout.css)
